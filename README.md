# Eleventy Dev Pack

# Setup Dev

This project was built using node 22. You can install this using nvm.

To setup the workspace, and get started with dev do this:

1. Run `nvm use 22`
2. Run `npm i`
3. Open the project in vscode
4. Run `npx eleventy --serve`

Now when you navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` you'll see your changes reflected (so long as they don't cause the eleventy builder to fail)
