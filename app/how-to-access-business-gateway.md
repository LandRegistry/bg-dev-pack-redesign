  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">Business Gateway allows you to integrate
    your data directly with HMLR systems. You can tailor how you work with us to fit neatly into your existing
    processes – including using client information already in your case management system (CMS) to create
    applications. Using Business Gateway can save time and reduce errors.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">If you do not already use a CMS and do not
    need to streamline or automate processes, then you can submit applications using our <a class="govuk-link"
      href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-registration-service" rel="noreferrer noopener"
      target="_blank">Digital Registration Service portal (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">There are two ways to set up Business
    Gateway:</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-left-3">Direct access</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">Direct access to Business Gateway means
    when your business links its own existing system or creates a new system that integrates directly with Business
    Gateway. This access route is often most suitable for companies that have a designated IT resource with
    development capability. It can be customised specifically to your business needs, creating a bespoke direct
    access platform.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">The timeline for setting up a direct
    integration platform depends on your internal IT capability and the complexity of the services you are
    integrating with.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">We recommend you review the requirements
    and set-up process with your IT team before starting your direct integration application. They can <a
      class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/business-gateway-developer-pack"
      rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">read the technical specification (opens in new tab)</a> and get an
    understanding of what is required.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-left-3">How to set up access</h3>
  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number govuk-!-margin-left-3">
    <li>Sign the development license which can be requested by emailing <a
        href="mailto:channelpartners@landregistry.gov.uk">channelpartners@landregistry.gov.uk</a>. If you are outsourcing the IT development work, the other
      party will need to sign the development licence.</li>
    <br>
    <li>We'll send a test SSL certificate to the technical contact. This gives your IT team connectivity and access
      to the test environment so they can start the integration process. Once you have gained connectivity, the
      integration support team will provide technical and onboarding support throughout the build process.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-left-3">Going live</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-left-3">To push content from a test to live environment, you’ll need to <a
      href="/contact-us">contact us</a>. You should only request a Business Gateway application form if:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-left-3">
    <li>the CMS is installed on your own machines or servers</li>
    <li>you are developing in-house </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">You will need to have a business
    e-services account in place before you can request live access.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-left-3">Third party access</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-left-3">Lots of third party suppliers have developed software that allows
    access to Business Gateway through a shared CMS platform. Most of our customers access Business Gateway this
    way. Not all third party platforms can be customised specifically to your business needs but they can provide
    direct integration for most core HMLR processes. This route to access Business Gateway is usually preferred by
    businesses with no IT development resource. If you already have a CMS, the provider might already have Business
    Gateway integration capability.</p>
