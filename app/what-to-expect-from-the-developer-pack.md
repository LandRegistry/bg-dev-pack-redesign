<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">What to expect from the developer pack</h1>
<div class="govuk-grid-row">
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">The Business Gateway developer pack
    provides a set of tools, documentation and examples for developers who create software applications for
    customers. Although the pack is designed to support developers, it may also help others looking to understand
    how Business Gateway works.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">In this pack, you'll find:
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-left-3">
    <li>a guide to accessing Business Gateway</li>
    <li>our terms of use policies</li>
    <li>a list of the APIs we use and how to access them</li>
    <li>a list of available APIs to integrate</li>
    <li>a guide to testing what you’ve created</li>
    <li>additional support and contact information</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">If you are new to Business Gateway and
    would like an overview of how it works, you may find it useful to explore the Before you start section first.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">If you are looking for specific service
    and API information, you may find it useful to jump straight to the Explore APIs section.</p>
  <div class="govuk-inset-text govuk-!-margin-left-3">
    Any updates to the developer pack will appear under What’s new on the <a class="govuk-link"
      href="/">home page</a>.
