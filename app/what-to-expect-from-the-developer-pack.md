The Business Gateway developer pack provides a set of tools, documentation and examples for developers who create software applications for customers. Although the pack is designed to support developers, it may also help others looking to understand how Business Gateway works.

In this pack, you'll find:

- a guide to accessing Business Gateway
- our terms of use policies
- a list of the APIs we use and how to access them
- a list of available APIs to integrate
- a guide to testing what youâ€™ve created
- additional support and contact information

If you are new to Business Gateway and would like an overview of how it works, you may find it useful to explore the Before you start section first.

If you are looking for specific service and API information, you may find it useful to jump straight to the Explore APIs section.
