## Overview {.govuk-heading-m}

The Send a document API should be used to attach documents to your application.

There are two steps for sending a document:

1. A request to generate an upload URL
2. A request to upload the document

The request to generate an upload URL will respond with an HMLR URL that can be used to upload the document to. This URL is only active for 10 minutes after creation. The generate an upload URL endpoint will also return a document ID that can be used when using the Submit an application API. Documents uploaded via this process will be subject to HMLR security scanning.

Documents that have been uploaded can be used for up to 180 days, after which point they will be removed.

This diagram demonstrates how the Send a document API works to support users.

When the user sends the request to generate an upload URL, the HMLR system will respond with a URL that can be used to upload the document to. 

Users can then use this URL to upload the document to the system.

## How to test this API {.govuk-heading-m}

HMLR does not currently provide a test environment for integrators using our Business Gateway APIs. Instead, weâ€™ve provided example code to demonstrate what you should expect to see when developing your own services.
