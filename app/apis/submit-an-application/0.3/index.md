## Overview {.govuk-heading-m}


The Submit an application API will help users provide the necessary data to HMLR for updating the register. This API is asynchronous, returning a unique ID for the submission request which can be used when fetching the application status.

This API supports the following application types:

- Register update
- Transfer of part
- Dipositionary first lease (includes new lease and lease extension)
- Removing a default Form A restriction (JP1)
{.govuk-list--bullet}

The data in the request content contains information about:

- Addresses
- Documents
- Parties
- Transactions
- Titles

This diagram demonstrates how the Send a document API works to support users.

When a user submits information to update the register, the HMLR system will respond by sending a unique application ID. Users can use this ID to receive information about the status of their application.

## How to test this API {.govuk-heading-m}

HMLR has created a test environment for the Submit an application API. Weâ€™ve also provided example code to demonstrate what you should expect when developing your own services.
