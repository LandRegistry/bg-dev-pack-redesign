## Overview {.govuk-heading-m}

The Attach a message API allows users to attach text messages to an existing application. The [Notifications API](apis/notifications) can then be used to understand if the message has been successfully attached to the application. 

If users want to attach a document to an application, they will need to use the [Attach a document API](/apis/attach-a-document).

## How the API works {.govuk-heading-m}

  <img src="/assets/images/attach-message-with-notifications.png" alt="A diagram showing the interaction of the Attach a message API."></a>

This diagram demonstrates how the Attach a message API works to support users.  

When a user submits a message, the HMLR system will initially respond with an empty ‘202 Accepted’ response. Users will then receive a notification stating whether the attached message has been successful or not.

## How to test this API {.govuk-heading-m}

HMLR has created a test environment for the Attach a message API. We’ve also provided example code to demonstrate what you should expect when developing your own services.
