<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="overview">Overview for v0.2</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The new Submit an application to change the Land Register service API will help to lodge applications with
    HMLR to update the register or create a new lease or transfer of part. This service can be integrated using
    the <a class="govuk-body govuk-link" href="/learn-about-the-apis-we-use">REST core API</a>.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The new service will be faster and more responsive than before. It’ll help identify errors prior to
    acceptance of an application, resulting in fewer requisitions and an improved experience for customers.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Important changes</h3>
<div class="govuk-!-margin-left-0" style="background-color: #f3f2f1; padding: 10px;">
    <p class="govuk-body">The new service API will:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>collect and validate more data than the current version</li>
        <li>increase the number of automated checks on application data prior to submission</li>
        <li>automatically check the format and structure of data</li>
        <li>validate information added to the application against information already on the register</li>
        <li>in future, check, compare and validate the data you provide, and the information contained in the
            attached documents</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">In return, you'll benefit from:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>increased output and data quality: with built-in checks on all application types, including charge
            or transfer transactions, you’ll face fewer requisitions</li>
        <li>consistent results across services: you’ll get parity of outcomes across our digital services</li>
        <li>greater data confidence and automation: more accurate data will provide opportunities to streamline
            our processes and improve the service for customers</li>
        <li>error prevention: the system will help you catch and fix administrative errors before submission
        </li>
        <li>improved attachment process: attaching and classifying deeds will be quicker and more
            straightforward</li>
        <li>upgraded technology: you’ll benefit from a faster, more responsive platform</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-3"></div>
<p class="govuk-body">Using the new service API will mean that applications are only accepted onto the day list
    when the data provided is both valid and correct. Applications with validation errors will not be accepted.
    This will significantly reduce the number of avoidable administrative requisitions, identify common
    mistakes, such as name discrepancies or missing details, and increase our ability to automate applications.
</p>
<div class="govuk-!-margin-left-0" style="background-color: #f3f2f1 ; padding: 10px;;">
    <p class="govuk-body">Additional changes include:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Document uploads before application submission: you will now need to upload documents before
            submitting an application</li>
        <li>JSON format: instead of using XML, the request bodies for the new APIs will use the simpler, more
            efficient JSON format</li>
        <li>Asynchronous application submission: when you submit an application, a successful response means the
            request has been received. Acceptance and prioritisation will occur after validation has been
            applied</li>
        <li>Renaming applications to transactions: applications from the SOAP request are now referred to as
            Transactions</li>
        <li>New fields: transaction specific data has been included, initially for transfer and charge
            transactions including charge values and information on joint tenancies</li>
        <li>Removing notes: the Notes section is no longer included but additional data fields have been added
            to collect the data commonly found in this field. These include:</li>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-left-3">
            <li>ROE-ID (Registration of Overseas Entity ID) - this should be attached as a document of type
                <code style="color: #a71d5d">EVIDENCE</code> for the relevant transaction</li>
            <li>company charges certificate – a new boolean field, <code
                    style="color: #a71d5d">conveyancers_certificate</code>, has been added to capture this
                information. This value must be provided when a <code style="color: #a71d5d">CERT_REG_CH</code>
                document is uploaded</li>
            <li>name variation – names are now required to be an exact match</li>
            <li>cover letter – should now be uploaded as a document of type <code
                    style="color: #a71d5d">EVIDENCE</code> with the relevant transaction</li>
            <li>request to merge or close leasehold titles – the appropriate transaction type should now be
                selected for this purpose</li>
        </ul>
