## Overview {.govuk-heading-m}

The Download a document API provides a way to download documents created by HMLR. 

This API has one endpoint:

- `GET /v1/documents/{download_id}` - get the binary content of the document.

You may obtain a `download_id` from any of the following:

- Completion notifications
- Cancellation notifications
- Requisition correspondence notifications
- The `/correspondence` array in an [Application information API](/apis/application-information) response

## How to test this API {.govuk-heading-m}

HMLR has created a test environment for the Download a document API. Weâ€™ve also provided example code to demonstrate what you should expect when developing your own services. 

[View Download a document API test stubs](/apis/download-a-document/1.0/test-stubs).

{% from "govuk/components/inset-text/macro.njk" import govukInsetText %}

{{ govukInsetText({

}) }}
