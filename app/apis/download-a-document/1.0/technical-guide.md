## How to use the Download a document API {.govuk-heading-m}

### Obtain a `download id` {.govuk-heading-s}

Before you can use this service, you will need to obtain a `download id`. Currently the only way to do this is to submit an application to change the Land Register. This process will result in one of the following types of document being generated:

- requisition
- cancellation
- completion

The generation of each of these documents would trigger a notification to be sent via the [Notifications API](/apis/notifications), which would contain a `download id`. Once this notification is sent, the document will be available for download.

Note: A `download id` may be available in the [Application information API's](/apis/application-information) response before the notification is sent, under the `/correspondences` array. The document is not guaranteed to be available for download until the notification has been issued.

### Downloading a document {.govuk-heading-s}

Once youâ€™ve obtained the `download id` you can use it in a `GET` request to this service. The request is simple and will result in the document binary being returned (as long as your request method allows redirects).
