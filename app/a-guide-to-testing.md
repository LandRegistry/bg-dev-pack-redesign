    API</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">HMLR does not currently provide a test
    environment for the Submit an application to change the land register API. Instead, we’ve provided example code
    to demonstrate what you should expect to see when developing your own services.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">You’ll find test stub examples on API
    pages and example request and response code in the API technical guides.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">For additional support, <a
      class="govuk-body govuk-link" href="/contact-us">contact our integration support team</a>.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-left-3">Testing SOAP and REST APIs</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-regular govuk-!-margin-left-3">Information about testing SOAP and REST
    APIs will be added at a later date.</p>
